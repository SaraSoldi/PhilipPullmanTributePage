    <p class='quote'><em>“After nourishment, shelter and companionship, stories are the thing we need most in the world.” <br>
      <span> ― Philip Pullman</span></em></p>
    <p id='tribute-info'>Sir Philip Pullman was born in Norwich and educated in England, Zimbabwe, Australia and Wales.
      He studied English at Exeter College, Oxford. He is a British author of novels for children and young adults who is best
      known for the fantasy trilogy <em>His Dark Materials</em>: beginning with Northern Lights (The Golden Compass in the USA) in 1995,
      continuing with The Subtle Knife in 1997, and concluding with The Amber Spyglass in 2000.
      These books have been honoured by several prizes including the Carnegie Medal, the Guardian Children's Book Prize,
      and (for The Amber Spyglass) the Whitbread Book of the Year Award - the first time that prize had been given to a children's book.
      Pullman has received numerous other awards, including the Eleanor Farjeon Award and the Astrid Lindgren Award.
      <br>
      In 2008, The Times named Pullman one of the <em>"50 greatest British writers since 1945"</em>.
      In 2004 he was named the eleventh most influential person in British culture from BBC.
      He was <em>knighted in the 2019</em> New Year Honours for services to literature.<br>
      He published around twenty books mostly aimed to children, but read from a very mixed audience.
